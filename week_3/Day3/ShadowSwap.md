# Game Design Exercise: New Concept & Ideation

## 1. Game Concept: "Shadow Swap"

**Goal, Rules, & Core Loop** Reach the light portal by navigating a world where you can only walk on shadows. You have the power to "Swap" the light source to the opposite side of the room, instantly shifting the position of all shadows. The core loop consists of analyzing the geometry, swapping the light to create a path, and platforming across the darkness.

**Key Feedback** * **Action:** Performing a "Swap."
* **Feedback:** A brief, high-contrast visual flash (negative color inversion) accompanied by a heavy, mechanical *thud-click* sound effect.

## 2. SCAMPER Technique
**Subject:** *Tetris*

Using the SCAMPER method to reimagine the classic block-stacking mechanic:

| Letter | Strategy | Concept Idea |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **S** | **Substitute** | Replace rigid blocks with **viscous liquids** that harden after 3 seconds. |
| **C** | **Combine** | Combine stacking with **Combat**; clearing lines fires projectiles at an opponent. |
| **A** | **Adapt** | Adapt the gravity to a **circular well** where blocks fall toward the center. |
| **M** | **Modify** | Add **"Weight"** to blocks; heavy blocks can crush and break those beneath them. |
| **P** | **Put to Other Use** | Use cleared lines as **building materials** to bridge a gap in a platforming sub-game. |
| **E** | **Eliminate** | Eliminate the "Next Piece" preview to force **purely reactive** play. |
| **R** | **Reverse** | **Reverse the goal:** Start with a full board and "un-stack" by matching shapes. |

### Reflection
The **Reverse** (carving out shapes) and **Substitute** (liquid physics) prompts offer the most potential for a modern "New Concept" indie game.
