Level 1:
1. Narrative Adventure
2. The Modern 3D Era & Online Explosion (2000 - 2010)

Level 2:
In traditional games, progression is a straight line: checkpoints, save your progress, the end. 

Roguelites replace that line with a loop:

Permadeath: In standard games, death is a minor pause. With permadeath, failure is a total reset. Skill issues if you die, it's not the game it's you.

Procedural Generation: Traditional levels are static, allowing you to memorize enemy spots. Procedural levels change every time. No speed run with memorization for ya, get good or get out.

Level 3: 
Technological Advancement
Seamless world streaming allowed us to ditch "Loading" screens by fetching environment data from the disc in real-time.
This transformed traditional static levels into vast, uninterrupted 3D spaces that feel truly persistent and alive.

Community Trend
It turned the 90s chatroom obsession into a persistent, visual "Third Place" for shared social bonding.
Players shifted from simple text-based interaction to "living" together in a high-fantasy digital society.

The Game Pitch
"Metropolis Live" is an Urban Sandbox MMORPG where every shopkeeper, police officer, and kingpin is a real player technically what they are doing in GTA 6 but we can't play it yet *sigh*.
It offers a "living history" experience where your social reputation dictates your actual power within the city.
