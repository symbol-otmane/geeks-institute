# Team Communication & Collaboration — Short Exercise Answer

---

## 1️⃣ Communication Audit

### Communication Failure 1  
**Issue:** Designer added a new feature without informing developers  
**Why it’s a problem:**  
- Causes bugs and rework  
- Breaks trust between disciplines  
**Immediate improvement:**  
- Any new feature must be announced in the team channel + added to the task board before implementation  

---

### Communication Failure 2  
**Issue:** Overlapping tasks with no clear ownership  
**Why it’s a problem:**  
- Increases stress  
- Leads to duplicated or unfinished work  
**Immediate improvement:**  
- Assign one clear owner per task in the sprint board  

---

### Communication Failure 3  
**Issue:** Team avoids feedback to prevent conflict  
**Why it’s a problem:**  
- Problems surface too late  
- Quality drops over time  
**Immediate improvement:**  
- Schedule short, regular feedback moments with a clear framework  

---

## 2️⃣ Feedback Exercise (Observation → Impact → Suggestion)

**Observation:**  
A new feature was added to the prototype without informing the development team.

**Impact:**  
This caused unexpected bugs and delayed the sprint because developers were not prepared for the change.

**Suggestion:**  
Before adding new features, share them in the team channel and log them in the task board so everyone can align early.

## 3️⃣ Stress & Collaboration Solution

### Main Stress Factor  
- Task overlap combined with tight deadlines

---

### Two Practical Stress-Reduction Strategies

1. **Clarify priorities daily**  
   - Short daily check-in to confirm who is working on what  
   - Reduces uncertainty and duplicated effort  

2. **Limit work in progress**  
   - Fewer active tasks per person  
   - Focus on finishing before starting new work  

---

### Team Leader Preventive Action

- Introduce a simple sprint rule:  
  **No new features enter the sprint without team visibility and approval**  
- Review task ownership and workload at the start of every sprint

## Key Takeaway

Clear communication, early feedback, and simple structure reduce stress and prevent conflicts.  
Fast alignment turns pressure into productivity.
