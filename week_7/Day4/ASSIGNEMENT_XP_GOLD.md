# Designing a Complete Internal Communication & Feedback System  
## Moroccan Game Studio Case Study

---

## PART 1 – Diagnosis

**Root Causes & Issues**

1. **Undocumented decisions**  
   - Cause: Verbal decisions during coffee breaks or informal chats  
   - Consequence: Confusion, repeated work, loss of trust, especially for remote artists in Casablanca or Marrakesh  

2. **Misuse of communication channels**  
   - Cause: Mixing urgent sprint updates, design debates, and cultural banter in WhatsApp or Slack  
   - Consequence: Missed info, misunderstandings, or public embarrassment  

3. **Unstructured feedback**  
   - Cause: Feedback given emotionally during critique sessions  
   - Consequence: Designers feel judged, developers demotivated, feedback ignored  

4. **No upward feedback mechanism**  
   - Cause: Junior artists and developers afraid to speak up due to hierarchy culture  
   - Consequence: Managers unaware of delays, team disengaged  

5. **Micromanagement**  
   - Cause: Lack of clarity in roles for lead programmers vs junior designers  
   - Consequence: Reduced autonomy, slower delivery, burnout  

6. **Ineffective meetings**  
   - Cause: No structured agenda; extended tea breaks often disrupt focus  
   - Consequence: Time wasted, important voices silenced  

**Most Affected**
- Designers: feel unheard and judged  
- Developers: feel controlled  
- Managers: overwhelmed and misinformed

## PART 2 – Communication Architecture

### A. Communication Channels

| Channel | Purpose | Users | Frequency |
|---|---|---|---|
| Daily Stand-up | Progress & blockers | Project teams | Daily |
| Weekly Team Sync | Sprint planning & risks | Team + Managers | Weekly |
| Async Chat (Slack/Discord) | Quick coordination | All staff | Continuous |
| Decision Log (Notion) | Document design/game decisions | Leads & Managers | As needed |
| 1-on-1s | Feedback & growth | Manager ↔ Individual | Bi-weekly |
| Retrospectives | Process & cultural improvements | Project teams | End of sprint |

---

### B. Rules & Protocols

1. Decisions documented within 24h in Notion  
2. No public performance feedback; always private  
3. Async communication preferred for non-urgent topics  
4. All meetings require agenda + outcomes  
5. Response times: chat ≤4h, email/docs ≤48h  
6. Task changes require context (why + impact)  
7. One owner per decision  
8. Sensitive or cultural topics handled privately

## PART 3 – Feedback System

### A. Types of Feedback
- **Peer-to-peer:** structured, respectful, culturally sensitive  
- **Manager-to-team:** scheduled, objective, SBI-based  
- **Team-to-manager:** anonymous quarterly surveys + private 1-on-1s  

### B. Feedback Method: SBI (Situation–Behavior–Impact)
- **Reason:** Objective, non-personal, scalable, works across diverse Moroccan teams  
- **Application Example:**  
  - Situation: Sprint review for a Moroccan-themed level  
  - Behavior: Art assets delivered late  
  - Impact: Integration delayed, team frustrated  

### C. Feedback Safety
- Psychological safety emphasized; respectful language mandatory  
- Managers trained to de-escalate conflicts  
- Toxic feedback protocol: stop → reframe → private follow-up → escalate if repeated

## PART 4 – Crisis Simulation

**Scenario:**  
A senior developer criticizes a junior designer publicly, saying their Moroccan mosaic textures are “unprofessional and slow.”  

**Immediate Manager Action**
- Calmly interrupt, stop public criticism  
- Redirect discussion to neutral topics  
- Schedule private feedback session  

**Reframed Feedback**
- Situation: Level asset submission  
- Behavior: Assets submitted late  
- Impact: Integration delayed, affected workflow  

**System Failure**
- No rule preventing public criticism  
- Weak feedback framework  
- Ineffective meeting norms  

**Preventive Rule**
- All performance feedback must be private and structured via SBI

## PART 5 – Measurement & Improvement

| Metric | Measurement | Frequency | Action if Poor |
|---|---|---|---|
| Feedback Frequency | # feedback sessions | Monthly | Manager coaching |
| Team Satisfaction | Pulse survey score | Quarterly | Process review |
| Decision Clarity | % documented decisions | Monthly | Leadership review |
| Conflict Rate | Escalated conflicts | Quarterly | Training / mediation |
| Meeting Effectiveness | Post-meeting ratings | Monthly | Redesign meetings |

**Special Moroccan Notes:**  
- Incorporate local team culture (tea breaks, informal discussions) without disrupting workflow  
- Celebrate milestones with small team rituals (e.g., Moroccan sweets or music)  
- Use cultural examples in onboarding and feedback to increase relatability
