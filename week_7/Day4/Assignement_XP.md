# Iteration & User Testing  
## From Prototype to Improved Gameplay  

---

## Part 1 – Playtesting & Observation

### Prototype Description
- **Type:** Greybox digital prototype (PC)  
- **Genre:** Puzzle–platformer with cultural theme  
- **Objective:** Collect traditional Moroccan artifacts and reach the Medina gate  
- **Core Mechanic:** Timing-based carpet jumps and interaction with magical lanterns  

---

### Players Tested
- Player 1: Casual gamer  
- Player 2: Regular gamer  

---

### Summary of Player Behavior
- Both players learned movement quickly  
- Hesitation at first carpet jump sequence  
- One player failed repeatedly when activating lanterns in sequence  
- Engagement increased after first successful artifact collection  

---

### Key Observations
- Players ignored written instructions  
- Confusion about lantern activation sequence  
- Frustration after multiple failed jumps  
- High engagement once Moroccan-themed feedback (lantern lights, sounds) were noticed  

---

### Main Problems Identified
- Poor onboarding/tutorial clarity  
- Lantern activation feedback unclear  
- Early difficulty spike in carpet jumping section  

---

## Part 2 – Metrics & Feedback Analysis

### Chosen Metrics
1. Level completion rate  
2. Time to collect all artifacts  
3. Failure count at carpet jumps and lantern puzzles  
4. Total session duration  

---

### Collected Data

| Metric | Player 1 | Player 2 |
|---|---|---|
| Completion Rate | Yes | Yes |
| Time to Complete | 7:20 min | 5:05 min |
| Failure Count | 8 | 4 |
| Session Duration | 9 min | 6:30 min |

---

### Interpretation of Results
- High failure rate shows confusion with magical lantern mechanic  
- Longer completion time indicates difficulty spike in carpet jumps  
- Session duration suggests players enjoyed exploration but needed guidance  

---

### What the Data Reveals
- Gameplay is engaging and culturally rich but onboarding is weak  
- Difficulty curve needs smoothing  
- Core mechanics work but need clearer visual and audio feedback  

---

## Part 3 – Iteration & Improvement

### Problem → Solution Table

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| Players miss instructions | Replace text with animated visual tutorial featuring Moroccan symbols |
| Lantern activation unclear | Add glowing effects, sound cues, and particle effects when activated correctly |
| Early carpet jump difficulty spike | Add a safe practice area with small jumps before main sequence |

---

### Implemented Changes
- Added animated Moroccan symbols and arrows as visual tutorial  
- Lanterns now glow and play chime sounds when correctly activated  
- Inserted a “practice courtyard” before main Medina gate puzzle  

---

### Before / After Comparison
- **Before:** Confusion, repeated failures, frustration  
- **After:** Faster understanding, fewer failures, smoother gameplay flow, stronger cultural immersion  

---

### Next Iteration Plan
- Retest with 3–5 new players  
- Measure failure rate for carpet jumps and lanterns again  
- Fine-tune timing windows and lantern sequence if errors remain high  

---

## Final Reflection

### What Surprised You?
- Players loved the Moroccan-themed visual and audio cues but ignored written instructions  

### What Changed the Most?
- Player understanding and engagement after visual and cultural tutorial  

### What Would You Improve With More Time?
- Expand Moroccan cultural elements across multiple levels  
- Introduce more interactive artifacts and sounds for richer gameplay  
- Refine UI and difficulty balancing for a smoother experience
