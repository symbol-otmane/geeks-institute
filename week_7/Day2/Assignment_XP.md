## Step 2 — Development Report

Developed using **Unity 2D** with built-in physics.  
Started with a paper prototype to test jump arcs and timing.  
Implemented player movement, hazards (spikes, moving platforms), collectibles (coins), and score tracking incrementally.  
Used simple shapes and placeholder sprites to focus on gameplay and level flow rather than visuals.

## Step 3 — Problems Encountered

1. Jump height and timing felt off, making some obstacles frustrating.  
2. Collectibles were sometimes unreachable due to platform placement.  
3. Time constraints made it difficult to balance levels and hazards.

## Step 4 — Solutions / Adjustments

1. Tweaked gravity, jump force, and cooldown to improve movement responsiveness.  
2. Adjusted platform and collectible positions to ensure accessibility.  
3. Prioritized main mechanics and simplified level layouts to ensure a playable prototype within the time limit.
