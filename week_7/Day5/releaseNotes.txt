Release Notes – 3Cs Evolution


Game: V-Gas: The Last Floor
Version: 0.1 (Prototype Phase)
Date: 2025-12-25

Character:

 Initially designed as a 2D platformer character with basic left/right movement and jump.
 Transitioned to 2.5D, allowing limited depth movement (forward/back) while maintaining platforming mechanics.
 Final design evolved into a full 3D first-person perspective, with character controls adapted for immersive exploration and combat.

Camera:

 Started with a fixed side-view camera for 2D platforming.
 Updated to a semi-tracking camera for 2.5D to allow slight depth perception.
 Final version uses a first-person camera to enhance immersion and tension, fully aligned with character orientation.

Controls:

* Original controls were simple: move left/right and jump.
* Updated in 2.5D to include limited forward/back movement and camera-based adjustments.
* Final 3D version includes full first-person movement (WASD/analog stick), look controls (mouse/controller), and interaction inputs for combat, exploration, and puzzle mechanics.

Notes:

 The evolution reflects the team’s decision to increase player immersion and suspense in the laboratory setting.
 Future updates will refine first-person mechanics, camera responsiveness, and control feedback for smooth gameplay.
